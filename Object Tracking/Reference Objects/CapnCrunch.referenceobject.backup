PLACEHOLDER_FOR_TRAINED_REFERENCE_OBJECT

This file needs to be replaced with the actual .referenceObject file that you generate using Create ML.

To create this file:
1. Use Create ML (version 6 or higher, bundled with Xcode 16)
2. Train on your capncrunch.usdz file
3. Replace this placeholder file with the generated .referenceObject
4. The training process typically takes 4-16 hours

The generated .referenceObject file will be a zip archive containing the trained object recognition data.
